# collection: single "variable" used to store multiple values 
#   List = [] ordered and changable. Duplicates OK.
#   Set = {} unordered and immutable, but Add/Remove OK. NO duplicates 
#   Tuple = () ordered and unchangable. duplicates OK. FASTER

fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "coconut"] # this is a LIST

print(fruits)

# you can index each item in a list, the position folows the rules of the strings etc 0 1 2 3 
print(fruits[3]) # indexing the word "coconut"
print(fruits[0:3]) # indexing the first 3 words: apple, orange, banana 

# to find if a specific value is in a collection, use the "in" operator 
print("apple" in fruits) # returns TRUE 

# you can also iterate over collections with loops:

for fruit in fruits: 
    print(fruit)

# you can alter the list after as well. just index into a position and change the value. ex: 
fruits[0] = "pineapple"
print(fruits) # now the first value is pineapple 

# you can append an element (add a new element to the end of a list)
fruits.append("mango")

# you can also remove an element

# you can also insert an element at a given position in a list .insert(position, value)

# you can use the sort function to sort the elements in alphabetical order 
fruits.sort()
print(fruits)

# to reverse the order of a list use the reverse function
fruits.reverse()
print(fruits)

# to remove all the elements in a list you would use fruits.clear()
# to return the index of a value you would use print(fruits.index("coconut"))
# you can count the amount of times an element appears in a list fruits.count("item")

# Now, lets talk about SETS {}
# unordered, immutable, add/remove OK, NO duplicates 
pets = {"dog", "cat", "snake", "fish"}

print(pets) # when you print a set, it should be in a different order each time 

# You cannot index into a set because they are unordered 
# you cannot alter the values in a set, but you can add and remove 

pets.add("bunny")
print(pets)
pets.remove("fish")
print(pets)
# pets.pop()  this function will remove whatever element is first, no telling what that will be though 
# pets.clear() this function will clear all the elements in a set 

# FINALLY, lets talk about tuples: 
#   Tuple = () ordered and unchangable. duplicates OK. FASTER

colors = ("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "blue")
# len() function can be used in a tuple 
# in operator can be used in a tuple to check and see if an element in contained within one 

print(colors.index("green")) # finding the position of the color green in the tuple 
print(colors.count("blue")) # counts how many times blue appears in the tuple and prints 

# you can iterate over each element in the tuple as well 
# print(fruits)
for color in colors:
