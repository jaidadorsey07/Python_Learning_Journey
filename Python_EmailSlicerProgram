# Email Slicer Program

email = input("Enter your email: ")  # example email: jndorsey724@gmail.com

# to slice the email so that the username and domain are split, you need to find the index of the @
# there is a given index function for strings 

index = email.index("@")  # finding the index of the @ symbol 

username = email[:index]  # username is the index from the beginning to the @ symbol (non-inclusive)
domain = email[index + 1:]    # the domain is the index from the @ symbol to the end 
                              # to omit the @ symbol you add 1 to the position
print(f"Your username is {username} and domain is {domain}")
