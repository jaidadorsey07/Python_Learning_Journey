# for loops = execute a block of code a fixed number of times.
#             You can iterate over a range, string, sequence, etc. 

# Example: Counting down from 10 

# x is a counter 
for x in reversed(range(1, 11)):  # second number in range function is exclusive so you have to put 11 to count to 10
    print(x)                      # you can add another comma to the range function for the step ex. (start, end, step)
# this will print 1-10
print("HAPPY NEW YEAR!")

credit_card ="1234-5678-9012-3456"

for x in credit_card:  # you can print the entirety of a string using this loop (prints every char in credit_card)
    print(x)

# counting to 20 but excluding x 
for x in range(1,21):
    if x == 13:
        continue # skips the iteration of 13 
        # or you could use break to get out of the loop entirely 
    else: 
        print(x)
