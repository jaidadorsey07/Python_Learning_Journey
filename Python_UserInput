# USER INPUT 
# to accept user input, utilize the input() function 
name = input("Enter your name: ")

# If you wanted to mathatically manipulate the age, ex (age = age +1 )
# you would have to convert age from string to an integer '
# So, to manipulate:
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
age = age + 1

# using this input in a print statement 
print(f"Hello {name}")
print(f"You are {age} years old")

# User Input Exercise 2: Volume/Area of a Rectangle 
# This program will calculate the area of a rectangle based on user input 
length = int(input("Enter the length of the rectangle (in inches): "))   # prompting the user for the length
width = int(input("Enter the width of the rectangle (in inches): "))     # prompting the user for the width

Area = length * width # equation for area of a rectangle 
Volume = length * width * height # equation for volume of a rectangle 

print(f"The area of the rectangle is {Area} in^2")   # displays calculated area 

print(f"The volume of the rectangle is {Volume} in^3")   # displays calculated volume 

# User Input Excercise 3: Shopping Cart 
item = input("What item would you like to buy?: ")
price = float(input("What is the price?: "))
quantity = int(input("How many would you like?: ")) 

totalprice = quantity * price 

if quantity == 1:
     print(f"You have added {quantity} {item}. Your total is ${round(totalprice, 2)}") # rounding the total to 2 decimal points 

else:  
    print(f"You have added {quantity} {item}s. Your total is ${round(totalprice, 2)} ") # rounding the total to 2 decimal points 


# review: to trunctate a float to a specific number of decimal points, use the round() function and include the number of decimal
# points you'd like to go up to after the variable, follwing a comma, (like shown above)
