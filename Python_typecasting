# typecasting: the process of converting one data type to another
#                   (string, integer, float, boolean)
#                  Explicit vs Implicit

# EXPLICIT TYPECASTING: manually converting a varaible into a different data type

name = "Jaida"    # String 
lastname = ""
age = 18          # Integer 
gpa = 3.5         # Float 
student = True    # Boolean

# Printing the type of the variables (name should be a string)
print(type(name))
print(type(age))
print(type(gpa))
print(type(student))

# typecasting ex. converting age to a float type 
age = float(age)
print(age)         # now the value should be 18.0
print(type(age))   # and variable type will be float 

# typecasting ex. converting gpa to a integer 
gpa = int(gpa)
print(gpa)         # now the value should be 4
print(type(gpa))   # and variable type will be integer 

# typecasting ex. converting student boolean to a string 
student = str(student)
print(student)         # it should now be the string "True"
print(type(student))   # and variable type will be string

# typecasting ex. converting age to a boolean
# Any value that is not 0 will be true pos or neg 

age = bool(age)
print(age)
print(type(age))

# typecasting ex. converting lastname to a boolean
# this is useful when seeing is a user inputs something valid when prompted 
# ex. if a user is asked for their name and they enter nothing, it will be false. 

lastname = bool(lastname)
print(lastname)
print(type(lastname))


# IMPLICIT TYPECASTING: when a value or variable is converted into a differnet data type automatically 

x = 2      # integer 
y = 2.0    # float 

x = x / y  # dividing an integer(x) by a float(y)

# printing x to see what data type it is now
print(x)

# x is now a float (1.0)
