friends = 10

# friends = friends + 1   (This is how we would typically manipulate a variable to add one to it, however...)
# you can also use: 
# friends += 1  # This also translates to friends = friends + 1 

# if you wanted to do a subtraction problem instead you could say 
# friends -= 2 

# for multiplication: 
# friends *= 3

# for division
# friends /= 2 

# for exponents (friends = friends **2)
# friends **= 2 

# if you want the remainder of a division equation, you assign a modulus (%) 

remainder = friends % 3 # friends divided by 3 will give you a remainder of 3
