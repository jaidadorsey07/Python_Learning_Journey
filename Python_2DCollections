# 2d list: A list made up of lists 

# Creating the individual lists: 
fruits =     ["apple" , "orange" , "banana", "coconut"]
vegetables = ["celery", "carrots", "potatoes"]
meats =      ["chicken", "fish", "turkey"]

# Creating the 2D list: 
groceries = [fruits, vegetables, meats]

# printing the 2D list 
print(groceries)

# to index into a 2d list you would use the regular indexing formatting 
print(groceries[0]) # this will print the first list within the 2D list 

# to index into a specific list WITHIN the 2d list you would have to use 2 index operators 
print(groceries[1][2]) # compairable to coordinates 

# if you need to iterate over the elements of a 2D list, you can use a nested loop 
for collection in groceries:
    for element in collection:
        print(element)

for line in num_pad: # for each tuple in num_pad

        print(element, end=" ") # print each element while keeping them structured in a line with the elements in their associated tuple
    print() # print a new line after each tuple
