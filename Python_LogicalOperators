# Logical Operators = used on conditional statements 

#               and = checks if two or more conditions are true
#               or  = checks if at least one condition is true 
#               not = True if condition is False, and vice versa 

# Example: we are running a program that is checking temperature 

temp = 40 
sunny = True 
rain = 3

if temp > 0 and temp < 30:               # Using the 'and' logical operator 
    print("The temperature is good")
else: 
   print("The temperature is bad")

if rain <= 0 or rain >= 30:             # Using the 'or' logical operator 
     print("The temperature is bad")
else: 
     print("The temperature is good")

if not sunny:                           # Using the "not" logical operator 
    print("It is cloudy outside")
else:
    print("It is sunny outside")
